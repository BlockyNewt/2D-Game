# 2D Game
Was messing around with a new C++ library call SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and just made a simple 2D game. Had to stop working on it due to work getting busy, but all the mechanics in the game work. 

In game Mechanis include...
1. Level creation
2. Character selection and naming
3. Inventory, bag to keep goods, quests, skill tree, gathering
4. Hotbars to load learned skills onto from the skilltree to use in combat
5. Combat
6. Progression
7. Looting of dead bodies
8. Mining, herbalism, and Harvesting
9. Load levels you created in the level creation and test it in "Test Zone"
10. Sounds for everything
11. Levels and stat increases on level up
12. Equipping and unequipping of items on character
13. Item shop
14. Money
15. Three different resolutions
