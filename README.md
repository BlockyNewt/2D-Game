Was messing around with a new C++ library call SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and just made a simple 2D game. Had to stop working on it due to work getting busy, but all the mechanics in the game work. 

In game Mechanis include...
1. Level creation
2. Character Select and naming
3. Inventory, bag to keep goods, quests, skill tree, gathering
4. Hotbars to load learned skills onto from the skilltree to use in combat
5. Combat
6. Progression
7. Looting of dead bodies
8. Mining, herbalism, 
9. Character selection and naming
10. Load levels you created in the level creation and test it in "Test Zone"
11.
